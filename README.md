### What is Wafer? ###
Wafer is a decentralized router sharing. The platform supports two options: to distribute the Internet for rent through a router or
to lease traffic from an Internet router that distributes it. With the advent of the platform, people no longer have to do without
the Internet when it is so necessary - at any time the user can find the nearest distributing router and rent traffic.

### How does it work? ###
The user who distributes the Internet through the router assigns a price for 1 MB, a deposit for one session (for example 100 MB)
and sends them to the user-tenant. Then, the user-tenant has the opportunity to accept the conditions of the lessor or reject them.
If the tenant has agreed to the terms, a smart contract is concluded between the tenant and the lessor. At the moment when the
tenant sends out the necessary deposit, the router starts to distribute traffic to the client. Once the client has spent the
deposit or stops using the traffic, the server keeps track of this and issues an invoice to the client. Next, 24 hours pass after
the session is closed. If the client agrees with the invoice, then the remainder of the unspent deposit is sent to him, and the
amount of money that he requested is credited to the account of the router. If the client does not agree with the invoice and
considers that the router has deceived him, he will report about it, then the client will get the amount of money that the router
left him, and router will get nothing. Therefore, routers are not profitable to cheat and recalculate customers. In this project we
are using Solidity for developing smart-contract and Ethereum blockchain for keeping contracts.

### How is it innovative? ###
We are used to arrive in unfamiliar place and rent a car in carsharing or hire a flat, using airbnb. It is highly unlikely that we
will be able to find net access without the use of mobile web, even if we are in our city. Nowadays there is no one platform, which
can resolve this problem. The Wafer not only erases this problem, but it uses smart-contracts and blockchain to create
decentralized system. You donâ€™t want to pay to third-party company such as airbnb, because of you have smart-contract. Thereby,
user- router interaction will occur directly and the contract cost will be less than disbursement fee.

### The biggest obstacle ###
At the begining of hackathon we now just a little bit about blockchain. In our team there are 3 participants who learn Maching Learning and Data Analysis at university, in the 3rd course and and the last one is 1C engineer. So it was a challenge for us, because we developp for blockchain in the first time. We have some problems with undertanding how to write smart contract and also it was a little challenge for us to write a good client-server application. But despite of all this things it was really awsome hackathon and we beat ours goal to learn more about blockchain and smart-contracts.
